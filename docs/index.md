I'm a software engineer specializing in distributed systems, scalability, reliability, and observability topics. I have extensive experience **designing, implementing, and operating reliable systems**. Meanwhile, I love meeting challenges, learning, and sharing.

My life philosophy relies on 改善 (Kaizen, ‘change for better’). In a nutshell, it’s not important how fast you can be; what’s essential is to **improve continuously**. I strive to apply this philosophy to my personal and professional life, constantly seeking to learn and grow.

I have 12 years of experience in software engineering. I’m currently working at **Google** as a senior software engineer SRE in the ML Compute team. Before that, I worked in different companies. At Docker, I was a software engineer in the registry team, maintaining systems like Docker registry, Hub & search. At Beat, I was a staff engineer in the matching domain, where I designed, implemented, and operated critical services with a strong focus on reliability and observability. At Utility Warehouse, I refactored the company’s notification platform from a distributed monolith to a microservice paradigm leading to an elastic architecture and an average latency reduction of +90%. At SkySoft-ATM, I worked in a safety-critical environment in the context of the Swiss air navigation service provider, where I designed, proposed, and implemented the company's central data repository used to store and compute flight events. Before, I worked as a tech lead and architect at Axa and Airbus Helicopters.

In 2022, I **published a book** called [100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them](book.md). This book shows common programming mistakes in Go and how to fix them using idiomatic code. So far, it has a pretty cool note of 4.7/5 (avg on Amazon, Goodreads, and Manning), and I’m delighted that it helped that many people (over 8k copies sold, translated in five languages). Furthermore, in 2024 I released a daily [newsletter](newsletter.md) for coders and I keep writing on my [blog](https://teivah.medium.com/) from time to time (50+ posts, ~800k visits).

Last but not least, I'm also an **open-source** enthusiast ([GitHub](https://github.com/teivah)) and a **public speaker** ([my talks](talks.md)).
