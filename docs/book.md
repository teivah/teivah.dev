# 100 Go Mistakes

In 2022, I published my first (_and last_) book: _100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them_.

## Book

If you're a Go developer looking to improve your skills, this book is for you. With a focus on practical examples, _100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them_ covers a wide range of topics from concurrency and error handling to testing and code organization. You'll learn to write more idiomatic, efficient, and maintainable code and become a proficient Go developer.

!!! tip "Krystian (Goodreads user)"

    This is an **exceptional book**. Usually, if a book contains either high-quality explanations or is written succinctly, I consider myself lucky to have found it. This one combines these two characteristics, which is **super rare**. It's another Go book for me and I still had quite a lot of "a-ha!" moments while reading it, and all of that without the unnecessary fluff, just straight to the point.

!!! tip "Akash Chetty"

    The book is completely **exceptional**, especially the examples carved out for each topic are really great. There is one topic that I struggled to understand is Concurrency but the way it is explained in this book is truly an art of genius.

!!! tip "Neeraj Shah"

    This should be the **required reading** for all Golang developers before they touch code in **Production**... It's the Golang equivalent of the legendary 'Effective Java' by Joshua Bloch.
